# Operating-System---Process-Scheduling

-- Simulations of CPU Scheduling Algorithms -- 

5 types of process scheduling algorithms will be used in this code are.. <br/>
    1. Round Robin (Quantum = 3) -> works okay <br/>
    2. Preemptive SJf            -> did not work <br/>
    3. Non-preemptive SJF        -> works okay <br/>
    4. Preemptive priority       -> did not work <br/>
    5. Non-preemptive Priority   -> works okay <br/>
